# Geometry Calculator

## Project Description
# The Geometry Calculator is a text-based Python program that allows users to create, view, compare, and sort various geometric shapes.
# Users can choose from circles, rectangles, squares, and multiple types of triangles (right-angled, equilateral, isosceles, scalene).
# Each shape supports calculations for area and perimeter and includes formula explanations.
# Shapes are named automatically (e.g., 'circle 1', 'triangle 2') and stored in memory for comparison and sorting.

## Installation
---
# 1. Clone the repository or download the project files from GitHub.
# 2. Ensure you have the "Helper functions" folder downloaded from this GitHub repository (if not downloading the entire repository):
#    [https://github.com/MarkBishopUcas/CP2-PROJECTS](https://github.com/MarkBishopUcas/CP2-PROJECTS)
#    Ensure that the "Helper functions" folder is located in the same directory as the geometry calculator project, but **NOT inside it**.
# 3. Make sure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your system.
# 4. Install any required dependencies by running the following command:
#    `pip3 install InquirerPy`

## Execution and Usage
---
# To run the project, execute the `main.py` script. The program launches a menu-driven interface to create and interact with shapes.
* Start the program by running `main.py`.
* Add new shapes by selecting their type and entering dimensions.
* View information about all saved shapes.
* Compare any two shapes by area and perimeter, with difference values and names displayed clearly.
* Sort shapes by either area or perimeter and display their details in order.

## Used Technologies
---
* **Python** - Core language used to build the logic and structure.
* **os** - Used for file path operations (standard library).
* **sys** - Used for file path operations (standard library).
* **InquirerPy** - Navigational menus

## Current Features
---
* Create and name multiple geometric shapes.
* Support for triangle types: right-angled, equilateral, isosceles, scalene.
* Area and perimeter calculations with shape-specific formulas.
* Compare any two shapes and display differences.
* Sort shapes by area or perimeter in descending order.
* Clear and friendly menu-driven interface using arrow key selection.
