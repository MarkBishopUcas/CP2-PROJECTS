# Battle Simulator

## Project Description

Battle Simulator is a turn-based combat game where players choose a character and engage in battles against CPU-controlled opponents. The game features character customization, randomized attacks, critical hits, dodging mechanics, and a leveling system. Players must strategically use normal attacks, power attacks, and healing to defeat their opponents.
